# GenericDS

![alt text](./src/assets/image.png)

GenericDS is an open-source and community maintained component library, aimed to become a generic design system which would enable developers to quickly build scalable, efficient and themed UIs without any hassle.

Visit the [GenericDS storybook](https:generic-ds.swapnilsachan.me) to explore all the available components.

Install GenericDS in your project using npm:

```sh
npm install generic-ds
```

or yarn:

```sh
yarn add generic-ds
```

## Features

- Flexible and themed UI components
- Community maintained
- Easy to use and customize
- Scalable and efficient

## Tech

This project is being built on top of following technologies (these may change as we make progress):

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - An open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, and Angular
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) - A visual testing platform that helps you catch UI bugs before they reach production
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - A package manager for JavaScript
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript (for type-safety ofc!)

And of course GenericDS itself will be forever open-source at [swapnilsachan03/generic-ds](https://github.com/swapnilsachan03/generic-ds).

## Running locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/swapnilsachan03/generic-ds
cd generic-ds

npm run storybook
```
